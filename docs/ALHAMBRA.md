# Tilings in art and architecture — Alhambra and beyond

The **17 wallpaper groups** are not only a mathematical classification; they appear in art, architecture, and craft across cultures. The most famous example is the **Alhambra** in Granada, Spain.

## The Alhambra

The Alhambra (Nasrid dynasty, 13th–14th century) is renowned for its **geometric tilework** (zellige-style patterns). Studies have shown that a large number of the **17 wallpaper groups** are represented in its pavements and walls:

- **p4**, **p4m** — Square and square-with-mirror patterns (4-fold rotation) are very common.
- **p6**, **p6m** — Hexagonal and 6-fold patterns appear in many star-and-polygon designs.
- **p3**, **p3m1**, **p31m** — 3-fold (triangular) symmetry is also present.
- **pm**, **pmm**, **pg**, **pgg**, **cmm** — Rectangular and glide patterns occur in friezes and repeated panels.

So the Alhambra is a striking real-world illustration of the fact that the 17 groups exhaust the possible symmetry types for periodic plane tilings: you can find (or reconstruct) examples of many of them there.

## M. C. Escher

M. C. Escher used **periodic tilings** with recognizable figures (fish, birds, lizards) that fit together without gaps. Many of his works correspond to specific wallpaper groups (p4, p6, etc.). WebEscher’s name and goal are inspired by this: edit a prototype tile and let the group’s symmetries fill the plane, with optional homothety for perspective effects.

## Zelliges and Islamic tilings

**Zelliges** (North African and Andalusian tile mosaics) often use the same symmetry groups: 4-fold and 6-fold patterns, glides, and reflections. The unit is usually geometric (star, polygon); the repetition is exactly what the wallpaper groups describe. Using WebEscher with **p4**, **p6**, or **p4m** is a good way to explore the same kind of structure with your own motif.
